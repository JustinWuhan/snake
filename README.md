# snake
Just a simple snake game written in an OOP style using the pygame library

The environment is set up using pipenv.  To run the game:
1. Ensure you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) installed. This game was written using python 3.5.3 but should be compatible with any version of python3
2. Next clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/YungSwalay/snake.git`
3. Navigate to the new snake directory, `cd snake`, and install dependencies, `pipenv install`.
4. Now to run the game, `pipenv run python main.py`
5. Enjoy!
